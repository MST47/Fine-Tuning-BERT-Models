# Fine-Tuning-BERT-Models

## 1. Introduction
BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a pre-trained transformer model developed by Google. It is designed to understand the context of words in a sentence in a bidirectional manner, making it highly effective for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The BERT-Base model is a smaller, yet powerful version of the original BERT model, consisting of 12 transformer layers with 110 million parameters.
Fine-tuning a BERT-Base model involves adapting the pre-trained model to a specific NLP task by training it further on a task-specific dataset. This process allows the model to learn nuances and patterns related to the new task, enhancing its performance.

Fine Tuning of BERT-Base consists of the following steps:

**1. Dataset Preparation**
**2. Model Loading and Training**
**3. Training Setup**
**4. Fine Tune and Evaluation**
**5. Inferences**

### 1. Dataset Preparation:
**Load Dataset**:
Ensure your data frame has three columns: Label (numeric), Label Text (plain language), Text.

**Data Inspection**:
Check data distribution across classes to ensure balance.

**Data Preprocessing**:
Clean data by retaining only necessary columns.

### 2. Model Loading and Training:
**Loading Model**:
Choose a classification model from Hugging Face and load it along with its tokenizer. Link numeric labels with text labels for easy interpretation.Configure the model and utilize GPU for training.

**Tokenization**:
Convert data frame to Hugging Face dataset object. Tokenize text data and remove unnecessary columns.

### 3. Training Setup:
**Hyperparameters**:
Set training arguments to optimize model performance. Optuna can be used for hyperparameter tuning.

**Metrics Calculation**:
Use sklearn to calculate metrics like accuracy, especially mindful of class imbalance.

### 4. Fine-Tuning and Evaluation:
**Training**:
Initialize the trainer with model, tokenizer, and training arguments. Monitor outputs after each epoch.

**Note**:
Reduce the batch size to 8 if encountering "Out of Memory" errors. Use training, validation, and test data splits to properly evaluate hyperparameters.

### 5. Inference:
**Prediction**:
Make predictions on the test set and inspect results.
